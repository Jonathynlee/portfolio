        Hello! Welcome to this page that will tell you a little more about who I am and what I am qualified to do. <br><br> It all started 23 years ago, when I was bo.... You know? You probably don't want to hear back that far... On a more professional note, I graduated with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from California State University, Long Beach where I learned to think mechanically, build, calculate and produce products. Classes range from Physics, Mathamatics, Matlab, Thermodynamics, Material Science to Advanced Control Systems and Finite Element Analysis. <br><br> These courses tought me so much but I thought it was time to test myself even further. I have joined a coding boot camp to further my knowledge of software. On this website, you will find my work and how it is relavent to today's technology.
